# Exercise 2

## Question:
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides. You will be given the
three sides of a triangle, check if it is an equilateral triangle. Note: Assume that the given number
triples comply the triangle property (any one side is smaller than the sum of the other two sides).

## Input specification:
You will be given 3 integers (s1, s2, s3) where 0 ≤ (s1, s2, s3) ≤ 10 million.

## Output specification:
Show "Yes", if it complies the isosceles triangle property. Show "No",
otherwise
