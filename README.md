# EXERCISE 5 

There is a piece of cheese in a rectangle with the size of N x M . Poor little mouse wants to eat the
entire cheese. Starting at an arbitrary cell, he is eating regular slices (1x1) of cheese, and then passes
to the next (Only if it has not eaten). Help small little mouse to draw the route such that he eats all
the cheese.

## Input
In the first line the numbers N and M is given. (1 <= N , M <= 30).

## Output
Withdraw the route as a sequence of a mouse coordinates pieces, which he eats. Slices of cheese are
the coordinates of 1 to N on the X, from 1 to M on Y axis.
